LF AI & Data Egeria
---

Egeria base environment has now been deployed to Kubernetes.
It may take a minute or so for everything to start up.

Use 'helm show values egeria/egeria-base' if installed direct from repo to see all
configurable values

By default a single platform is created using the latest release of Egeria, with a single
metadata server 'mds1' and a view server 'view1'. The UI organization name is 'org'.
A job is started to perform this configuration and may take up to 10 minutes to complete.

Please provide any feeback via a github issue at https://github.com/odpi/egeria-charts or
